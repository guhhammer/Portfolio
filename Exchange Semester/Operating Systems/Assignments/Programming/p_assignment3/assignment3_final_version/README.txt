Hy, professor. 


I just want to say that the folder assign3_complete has nothing to
do with this project. I was transfering the files from my home folder
and, accidentally, moved the folder. The folder does not interfere 
anything in the submission folder. So, please, ignore the folder 
assign3_complete in the submission folder. My programming assignment 3
answers are just the files.

Have a good day.


Sincerely,
Gustavo Hammerschmidt.
