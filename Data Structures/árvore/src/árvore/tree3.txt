Not every alternate choice leads to a drastically different story, but some will. Sometimes it might lead to the same result, but by a surprising new means. Sometimes it might change your relationship with another character and unlock a path that wasn't there before. Sometimes it might result in death, whether that be of a supporting character or one of the central trio (they can all die at points throughout Detroit), or a dramatic action sequence with unexpected consequences. Comparing endings, not only between my first and second playthroughs but with other players, was astounding, particularly when I assumed everybody's story had wrapped the same way as mine and found that nobody's had.

For me, this is the biggest draw of Detroit. One playthrough really isn't enough to see what it has to offer, and characters and worldbuilding are interesting enough that it was a pleasure to go back to see what I'd missed in scenarios that are deceptively complex.
