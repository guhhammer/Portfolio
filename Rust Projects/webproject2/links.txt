TODO:
--------------------------------------------------------
- Project README.MD.

- Reupload .git projec with all rustprojects I made.

- check ether-rs lib to work with smartc contracts.

--------------------------------------------------------

- fill guards/ ... /u, /admin only auth users. #maybe make no guards folder.

- .env vars - set sensitive

- make link logo on social media; onclick -> open screen-centered box with links.

- search:
--  empty -> svg on else svg off and result.
--  refresh on scroll end.
--  add categoy checkbox on input tag

- admin:
--  route is used for user verification requests. 
--  to see users in db, donations and others.
--  to see the meetings scheduled for verification.
--  make a meeting collection in mongo later and a snapshot of course.
--  button in /u triggers post request to make a meeting with form data sent.

- style:
--  organize elements in pages.
--  make adjustments.
--  change design.
--  make images not-clickable not-dragable.
--  check other necessities.
--  make .js files to pages.

- donation contract:
--  make donation contract.
--  check if folder location can be side to side to this folder.
--  check if I can have the folder within this one.
--  check if I can make the deploy of it by this main.rs.

- payment cards:
--  check apis to make payments with cards and convert it to crypto.

- changes:
--  make sender send to contract address.
--  the owner of contract will make transactions within x days.
--  define user rank for X days variance.
--  keep value locked in contract for some time.
--  say that is for privacy reasons.
--  use the locked value as stake.
--  current the user sends through contract to the receiver.
--  theoretically it could just send directly if it knew the address.

- ideas:
--  maybe embed idea of a patreon-like app alltogether with this project (but clear distinction).
--  maybe ember idea of a livepix-like app to this.
