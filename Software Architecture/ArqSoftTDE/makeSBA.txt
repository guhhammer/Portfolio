Space-Based Architecture
When designing a new system from scratch, a space-based approach provides several advantages.

Space-based architectures use a grid approach for both data storage and processing.
Data storage and access is virtualized.
The space takes care of both data communication and process coordination
Processing units are loosely coupled, and run in parallel.
Processes are coordinated through data and events.
