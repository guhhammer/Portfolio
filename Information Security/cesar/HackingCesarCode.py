"""
    Processes to hack the Cesar's Code:
        
        1- I Know that the encrypting process is based on Cesar's Code.
        2- Taking the first affirmative for granted, I can presume there's a code or a number going from 1 to 26 or, 
           to be more precise, 0 to 25.
        3- So I have 26 different combinations for possible phrases, therefore I can face ambiguity when using small 
           sentences like: Like or Love you. 
        4- I don't have the code but I know I can find the message trying different combinations, a useful shortcut 
           would be using cross-entropy based on the english language to test which result is more likely to be the 
           real message typed in english.
        5- I have to start from the point were it's only given to me the variables alpha and message.
        6- First I will try the method: hacking the key.
